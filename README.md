A batch script used to support *nix-like `#!` functionality in Windows.
Won't bork up command-line arguments or piped I/O¹.
Run without arguments / see help.txt for usage instructions.
See [mcdemigod.com/wshbang](https://mcdemigod.com/wshbang) for more info.

¹*NB* the "Open With" dialogue **WILL** discard command line arguments.
Hit "Always use..." to associate wshbang as the default -- subsequent invocations will work fine.
